# HAMMER.JS 

Hammer.js is a javascript object that can be used to control gestures on touch devices.

> I told you, homeboy /
> You *CAN* touch this /
> Yeah, that's how we living and you know /
> You *CAN* touch this

Why?

Hammer.js supports the following gestures:

- Tap
- Double tap
- Hold
- Drag
- Transform

## DEMO'S
We've created some demo's to show you the power of hammer.js

> Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on /
> Like that, like that

Something about start and end events?

### Code examples

### Compatibility
Hammer.js has been tested on iPad1 with iOS5, iPhone4 with iOS5, Samsung Galaxy S with Android 2.3.3 and Google Chrome 17. Requires jQuery for some simple event binding and position of the container element. On a desktop browser the mouse can be used to simulate touch events with one finger. On Android 2 (and 3?) the default browser doesnt support multi-touch events, so no transform callback

Not all gestures are supported on every device. This support matrix shows the support we have tested. Note that this is not extensive. If you've tested hammer.js on a different device, please let us know.
