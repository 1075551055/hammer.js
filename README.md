# Full rewrite of Hammer.JS.

http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/v2/

Lighter, smaller and more open, better events, grunt, and custom gestures possible.

It needs some testing on Windows8 with touch/mouse. I've added support for it, but am not able to test it...


## Todo

- Better code documentation, JSDOC?
- Better readme
- ~~Documentation about custom gestures~~
- Test on devices
- Fix demo's
- Explain why the rewrite
- Measure speed difference of V1 with V2
- Write Unit tests?
- ~~Write jQuery plugin~~
- ~~Write Debug tool?~~
- ~~Shift key multitouch on desktop~~
- Update website in gh-pages
- Still not compatible with IE8 and older, should fix this?
